\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a mixture $L_{2}$ - $L_{p}$ variational Retinex model with an adaptive texture map. First, we incorporated constraint terms on reflectance and illumination which further consider the characteristics of reflectance and illumination with a cost function of a minimization optimization problem. Next, we developed the adaptive texture map which is used to tune the noise reduction rate according to the brightness of an observed image. Moreover, the adaptive texture map contributes to reveal fine textures detail in the estimated reflectance. As the results, the proposed method can preserve texture details as much as possible while suppressing noise amplification and over-enhancement in the reflectance estimation, and smooth illumination as much as possible while keeping the structure information in the illumination estimation. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method can enhance low-light images more naturally than the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, in the LOE evaluation, the proposed method outperforms the other methods in almost all the images.
